## About this repository: *Proffy Mobile Front-End*

This is the Front-End for the mobile version, to use you will have to start the server that is here: [proffy-api-backend](https://github.com/lucasrennok/proffy-api-backend).

The server is an API that have the data from a SQLITE database.

**There aren't ways to select options that already exists at the database in the mobile version so:** -> At the filters you will have to put the information like this: the subject name as a string(for example: *'Física'*), the week day as a number(for example: *'0'* is sunday), the time as a string(for example: *'9:00'*).

*Obs.: You can't sign-up to give classes at the mobile version, only at the web version.*
